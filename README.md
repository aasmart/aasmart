## Welcome to my GitHub!

### Hello, I'm Alex
 - I'm currently a highschooler passionate about computer science, programming, and what they're capable of.
 - When I'm not programming, I work on furthering my artistic abilities through Blender and simply sketching (I may also just be gaming)
 - Basically a full time gymnast, student, and developer

### Currently Working On:
 - Take a Break: an application focused around staying active while at your computer
 - Scorekeeper: a silly little app to make keeping score during family game nights a little easier
 - An undisclosed game created with Unity
