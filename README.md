## Welcome to my GitHub!

### Hello, I'm Alex
 - I'm passionate about computer science, programming, and what they're capable of doing for the world.
 - When I'm not programming, I'm playing video games, 3D modeling, or petting some kind of animal

### Currently Working On:
 - Nudege: an app focused on creating reminders to change unhealthy habits while at your computer
 - Scorekeeper: a silly little app to make keeping score during family game nights a little easier
 - A game created with Unity
 
### I'm Willing to Do Commisions!
