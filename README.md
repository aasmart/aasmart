## Welcome to my GitHub!

### Hello, I'm Alex
 - I'm passionate about computer science, programming, and what they're capable of doing for the world.
 - When I'm not programming, I'm likely pursuing other passions like art or playing some video games.

### Currently Working On:
 - Nudge: an app focused on creating reminders to change unhealthy habits while at your computer
 - Scorekeeper: Inspired by family game nights that I wanted to collect data about, I'm working on an app to make keeping score during family game nights a little easier
 - Games created using the Unity game Engine
 - Connect Four: a project to learn backend and frontened development
 
### Desmos Graphs
I enjoy the intersection of math and computer science, and I sometimes express that through creating neat graphs in Desmos. Here's a showcase of a few of them
